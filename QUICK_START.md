# Quick Start Guide - Simplified Approach

## Current Status

- âœ… **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ðŸ”§ **Backend**: Has compilation issues, needs fixes

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Use SQLite for Development (Easiest)

```bash
cd backend

# Update .env file
echo 'DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"' > .env
echo 'JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"' >> .env
echo 'PORT=4000' >> .env

# Setup database
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. Fix Backend Issues

The main issues are:

- Apollo Server v3 compatibility
- TypeScript strict typing
- GraphQL type mismatches

### 3. Alternative: Mock Backend First

For immediate development, you can:

1. Continue using the frontend with mock data
2. Build out the UI completely
3. Fix backend issues incrementally
4. Connect real backend later

## What's Working Right Now

âœ… **Frontend Features**:

- Property listings with search/filtering
- Navigation to host features (Become a Host)
- User interface components
- Responsive design
- State management with Zustand

âœ… **Backend Foundation**:

- Complete database schema
- GraphQL type definitions
- Resolver structure
- Authentication setup
- Docker configuration

## Recommended Development Approach

**Phase 1**: Complete Frontend (Current)

- Polish all UI components
- Test all user flows
- Perfect the user experience

**Phase 2**: Fix Backend Issues

- Resolve TypeScript compilation
- Test GraphQL resolvers
- Set up database connection

**Phase 3**: Full Integration

- Connect frontend to real backend
- Replace mock data with API calls
- Add real authentication

This approach lets you see immediate progress while building a solid foundation.
