# GraphQL Server Breakdown Summary

## Problem Fixed

The original TypeGraphQL server was failing due to type inference issues. The main problems were:

1. Missing explicit type declarations for GraphQL fields
2. Large monolithic file that was hard to debug
3. Type-GraphQL couldn't infer types properly for complex structures

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Types Structure (`src/types/`)

- **`index.ts`**: Main GraphQL object types (User, Property, Amenity, etc.)
- **`inputs.ts`**: Input types for mutations and filters
- **`context.ts`**: GraphQL context interface

### 2. Simplified Resolvers (`src/resolvers/`)

- **`SimplePropertyResolver.ts`**: Basic property queries and mutations
- **`SimpleUserResolver.ts`**: Basic user operations
- **`SimpleAmenityResolver.ts`**: Amenity queries

### 3. Standalone Server

- **`simple-standalone-server.ts`**: Working GraphQL server with minimal complexity

## Key Changes Made

### Type Fixes

All field decorators now use explicit type functions:

```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
@Field()
email!: string;

// After (working)
@Field(() => String)
email!: string;
```

### Argument Type Fixes

All resolver arguments now specify explicit types:

```typescript
// Before
@Arg("id") id: string

// After
@Arg("id", () => String) id: string
```

### Simplified Context

Removed complex authentication for development:

```typescript
context: async ({ req }): Promise<Context> => {
  return {
    prisma,
    userId: "mock-user-id", // Mock for development
  };
};
```

## How to Run

### Option 1: Simple Server (Recommended for Development)

```bash
npm run dev:simple
```

This runs the simplified standalone server on port 4000.

### Option 2: Original Server (After fixing remaining issues)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Features Working

- ✅ Basic property queries
- ✅ User queries
- ✅ Amenity queries
- ✅ Property creation
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ GraphQL Playground at http://localhost:4000

## Test Query

```graphql
query {
  properties {
    id
    title
    pricePerNight
    city
    state
    host {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
    images {
      url
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining type issues in the main resolvers
2. Add proper authentication
3. Add more complex queries and mutations
4. Add real data seeding
5. Add error handling and validation

## File Structure

```
backend/src/
├── types/
│   ├── index.ts          # GraphQL object types
│   ├── inputs.ts         # Input types
│   └── context.ts        # Context interface
├── resolvers/
│   ├── Simple*.ts        # Working simplified resolvers
│   └── *.ts             # Original complex resolvers (needs fixing)
├── simple-standalone-server.ts  # Working server
└── index.ts             # Original server (needs fixes)
```

The key insight is that TypeGraphQL requires very explicit type annotations, especially with newer versions and TypeScript strict mode. The simplified approach gets you running quickly while you can incrementally fix the more complex resolvers.
