## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

1. **TypeScript**: All components must be fully typed
2. **Functional Components**: Use React hooks, no class components
3. **Zustand**: State management for global state
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
6. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Standard component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Define all props with types
}

export default function Component({ ...props }: ComponentProps) {
  // Hooks first
  // Event handlers
  // Render methods
  // Return JSX
}
```

### State Management Patterns

```typescript
// Zustand store structure
interface StoreState {
  // State properties
  // Action methods
}

export const useStore = create<StoreState>((set, get) => ({
  // State initialization
  // Action implementations with mock API calls
}));
```

### File Naming Conventions

- Pages: `page.tsx` (Next.js App Router convention)
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Stores: `camelCaseStore.ts`
- Types: `index.ts` in types folder
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`

### Mock Data Strategy

- Realistic data structures matching real backend
- Comprehensive coverage of all features
- Consistent data relationships
- Performance considerations for large datasets

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration (Future)

All components are structured for easy backend integration:

- Mock functions can be replaced with actual API calls
- Proper error handling already implemented
- Loading states included
- TypeScript interfaces ready for API contracts

### Authentication Flow

- JWT token storage (localStorage/cookies)
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Refresh token handling

### File Upload

- Photo upload for properties
- Profile picture management
- Document verification for hosts

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization with Next.js
- Code splitting with App Router
- Lazy loading for large components
- Efficient state management

## Deployment

- Vercel deployment configuration
- Environment variable management
- Build optimization
- Error monitoring setup

## Maintenance Guidelines
